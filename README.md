# Learning-Journey

This repository documents my journey as an Information Science Engineering student.  
I use this space to collect notes, beginner-level practice, and small experiments as I continue exploring technology.
This project was built to practice basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
References were used during learning.

## Areas I'm Exploring
- Basics of programming  
- Cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Web development basics  
- AI tools & general tech awareness  

## Repository Structure
- `notes/` — theory notes, summaries, workshop learnings  
- `practice/` — small beginner exercises (any language)  
- `certificates/` — PDFs/images of completed courses  

## Goal
To track my progress and stay consistent in learning.
